# dsc_phase1_project
This is the cumulative Phase 1 project for Timothy Fuger

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to research/analyze movie data from multiple sources in order to make a recommendation to a new movie studio company (Microsoft) on what types of movies they should pursue.

The primary ask from the company is that the type of movies they pursue are similar to the ones "doing best at the box office." From a business perspective, I believe that they are looking to receive the greatest return on the investment that is placed in the movie. To understand what has given the best ROI in the past, we must dig into the data on previous movies and analyze the metrics. We will also analyze the budgets of these movies to determine what the range of spending will be for a movie project.

In the results, we will recommend types of categorical data to pursue based on successful movies in the past.
